## High Performance Computing

Main project for 'High Performance Computing' course.<br>

I am using CUDA to accelerate the following computational kernels <br> 

- 2D-Convolution <br>
- Multiplication of Transposed with Normal Matrix and a Vector <br>
- Covariance of a matrix <br>

The original code for these kernels can be found in Code/ <br>

Detailed explanation of the project can be found in HPC18-19.pdf. <br>

All the answers with detailed explanations for each kernel can be found in the report file 5878_6339.pdf
